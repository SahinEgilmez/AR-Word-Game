# AR-Word-Game
 Augmented Reality based word game.
 
This project was prepared for Gebze Technical University Graduation Project 1 (CSE-395) course in 2018 Fall semester.

The aim of the project is to design an AR-based word game for school age children. Although the game is designed for children, a format that adults can play is preferred.

The game runs on a computer or tablet. A front camera must be connected to the device on which the game is running. The number of players can be from 3 to 5. If the game is played in a classroom or similar environment, the device can be connected to a projector or a smart board so that the audience can follow the game live.
 
The game has been prepared with a Turkish interface. Again, all questions consist of Turkish words. It can be adapted to other languages by making necessary changes within the project.

Python 3 and OpenCV were used in the project. [Kivy Framework](https://kivy.org/#home) was used for the game interface. [face-recognition](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition) module was used for face recognition. Thank you to the creators of this module:)

## Game Mechanics:
- Players are given the meaning of a word and are asked to find that word.
- Each of the letters that make up the word is displayed on the bodies of the players.
- Players try to find the word by changing places. If they find the word correct at the end of the given time, they earn points and move on to the next question.
